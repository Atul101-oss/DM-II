A bull market is a period of generally rising prices. The start of a bull market is marked by widespread pessimism. This point is when the "crowd" is the most "bearish".[7] The feeling of despondency changes to hope, "optimism", and eventually euphoria as the bull runs its course.[8] This often leads the economic cycle, for example, in a full recession, or earlier.

Generally, bull markets begin when stocks rise 20% from their low and end when stocks experience a 20% drawdown.[9] However, some analysts suggest a bull market cannot happen within a bear market.[10]

A decline of 10% to 20% is classified as a correction.

Bear markets conclude when stocks recover, reaching new highs.[14] The bear market is then assessed retrospectively from the recent highs to the lowest closing price,[15] and its recovery period spans from the lowest closing price to the attainment of new highs. Another commonly accepted indicator of the end of a bear market is indices gaining 20% or more from their low.[16][17]

From 1926 to 2014, the average duration of a bear market was 13 months, accompanied by an average cumulative loss of 30%. Annualized declines for bear markets ranged from
